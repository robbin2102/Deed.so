# Deed: A Decentralised Exchange for Internet Memecoins

Deed is a decentralized exchange for internet assets where users can tokenise any internet asset as Memecoins to discover its true & fair market value while generating passive income from trade fees. Traders can search & trade the next 100x gem based on internet asset data while earning ownership of the exchange through DEED tokens based on trading volumes. DEED is a utility token of Deed DEX that provides liquidity &  grants governance rights to users. 

## Introduction

On one hand, more than 40% of internet bandwidth is attributed to Big Tech (Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft) that hosts millions of assets & applications. Big Tech has solved mass content distribution at scale while being highly centralized institutions to accrue a market capitalization of  over $10 trillion over the last few decades. Even though Big Tech has accrued trillions in market cap yet there is no way to directly attribute a piece of this value to the assets owned by millions of creators & entrepreneurs hosting assets on Big Tech platforms. Whether a user owns a Youtube channel or an Amazon Seller account or a Saas Web app  or a Game App on an iOS store or just a simple website, they have no way of discovering the true market values of their assets. Some of these assets might be generating millions in cash flows for their owners, but still there is no way to discover their value. Traditional finance is expensive & inefficient to solve this & hence we need a DeFi solution.



On the other hand, thousands of memecoins are created daily on various decentralised exchanges acrosss chains & most are destroyed on the same day or within a short time frame by liquidity removals (below <$1000). Memecoins in their existing form lack utility besides speculation & offer a subpar trading experience to users as trading is not fundamentally based on any asset data. Duplicacy of memecoin symbols is another problem that prevents any form of utility, stability & longetivity to memecoin markets.  

In order to discover the fair market value of internet assets on-chain & add utility to memecoins, Deed Labs envisions to build a decentralized exchange for tokenizing & trading of internet assets as memecoin. This requires mechanisms to validate , tokenize & trade memecoins representing such internet assets in a way that each memecoin is uniquely attributed to their underlying internet asset on-chain. Mechanisms are also required to onboard asset data (subs, users, followers, earnings, gross revenues, news etc) on-chain for traders to make better trading decisions & yield farming mechansims that pass earnings to liquidity providers. At its core, the decentralized exchange contract is powered by concentrated liquidity pools (aka "Markets") with flexible fee tiers ranging from 1%-5% with increments at 500 basis pts. The exchange would be owned, operated & governed by users with incentives & governance (control) tied to their contributions to maintain full decentralization.

Deed aims to bring stability & longetivity to the memecoin markets where today thousands of tokens are created & destroyed everyday making it fun but only for speculative use case. Deed DEX not only makes trading memecoins linked to internet assets fun, but also adds a layer of utility through asset value discovery & a better data based trading experience. UI/UX design of existing memecoin DEXes lack critical data points or metrics necessary to trade some of which are then available on popoular DEX terminals like dexscreener, dextools or on some paid apps. Deed app will provide historical & real-time memecoins & connected internet asset data, metrics & news at one place to enhance trading experience like never before while making open source trading APIs and websockets available to traders for automated trading.



## In-App Tokenisation

To bring tokenisation to masses, Deed makes tokenisation feature in-built within the DEX. A user can select any internet asset & create memecoin tokens within 2 clicks. Deed DEX will be Solana first giving users the advantage of deploying tokens at lowest transaction fees amongst most L1 chains with substanatial TVLs. Once the tokens are minted, users can launch markets (concentrated liqudity pools) by depositing newly minted memecoin tokens along with a pair of Deed DEX native token (DEED) or any other token of their choice. Using DEED as a utililty token to pair in liquidity pools, would be encouraged via additional liquidity rewards based on trading volumes.  


## Concentrated Liquidity Pools

Deed DEX will enable any internet user to tokenise any internet asset as memecoins using Concentrated liquidity pools. Concentrated liquidity pools are more capital efficient than standard pools but require active position management by traders. Since Deed aims to also onboard non-crypto natives, most may not be able to understand or manage the complexity of concentrated liquidity pools offer. Hence Deed will offer an A.I bot that not only makes suggestion of price ranges for concentrated liquidity but can also actively manage a portfolio of positions based on target ROI & risk paramters set by a user.  

### Flexible Trade fee tiers

A user creating a liquidity pool can set custom trade fee tiers in the range of 1%-5% with increments at 500 basis pts, based on the type of assets, projected trading volumes & estimated earnings they would like to attain. This fee is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves. Deed DEX will retain 15% of trade fees from any fee tier set by the user.


### Asset data

In various Tradifi asset markets, trades are based on changes in asset fundamentals or technical patterns discovered by traders through broker terminals or news coverage. In Defi, without providing underlying real asset data to traders, most would be speculating rather than taking calculated decisions on token prices. Hence real asset data points like gross revenues, users, subscribers, patrons, churn, followers, ad earnings etc based on asset type are available on Deed DEX app to traders for making informed decisions regarding valuation of assets subject to approval of asset owners who can control release of asset data based on a set frequency or can approve real time data feeds based on their preferences for sharing asset data. The quantum & frequency of asset data shared can also help traders determine quality of an asset which would ultimately reflect in its valuation. 



### Asset validation 


Millions of token contracts that have been created so far across chains, however most lack utility as they are not linked with any underlying asset. Internet assets are linked with their on-chain memecoins through zero knowledge (ZK) proofs validating asset ownership, location & condition. In absence of ZK proofs , any user can claim to be owner of  a real asset by deploying contracts with duplicate token symbols. Adding metadata alone to token contracts doesnâ€™t solve the problem as they can be duplicated without validation proofs. Asset metadata (ownership, location, condition etc) can be validated through user authentication with trusted third party oracles that host or store such assets which can then be used to create & store zero knowledge proofs on-chain without revealing the access token or sensitive validation data. ZK-proofs can be verified publicly to confirm asset ownership. 



## Full Decentralization

In order to ensure continuity of Deed DEX it must be fully owned, operated & governed by its users in the long run. For any exchange contract to be fully decentralized it should distribute majority of its earnings to its users along with a path to progressively pass major ownership of the exchange to users based on defined metrics. Along with decentralization it is essential that users are incentivized enough to bootstrap & grow liquidity on Deed DEX for an indefinite period of time. Suitable mechanics are being designed to meet goals of full decentralisation & would be disclosed in due time.


### Earnings distribution

To incentivise creation of liquidity pools,  asset owners tokenizing internet assets can set a trade fee between 1-5% with increments of 500 basis pts . Trade fee tiers are open for revision based on voting by users of Deed DEX through DAO governance proposals.  85% of the trade fee goes to liquidity pools along with DEED rewards while 15% goes to DAO treasury. 


### Ownership distribution

The path to full decentralization begins as a variation of progressive decentralization whereby Deed DEX ownership is not allocated but rather earned by users & developers alike. Users earn DEED based on trade volumes or by converting trade fee earnings while developers are allocated DEED based on DEX development milestones. 

DEED has a fixed total supply of 1.5 billion tokens that can be earned by trading on DEX or by contributing towards development of the exchange. 1 billion (66.67% of total supply) tokens are reserved for users tokenising, providing liquidity & trading memecoins on Deed DEX while 0.5 billion tokens (33.34% of total supply) are reserved for Deed Labs, development team & private investors to be allocated over a period of time. Users earn 1 DEED for every $100 traded on DEX, which implies that 1 billion DEEDs would have been earned & distributed when Deed DEX attains a cumulative $100 billion of trading volume.  


## Deed DAO

All users of Deed DEX holding DEED shall be default members of Deed DAO with 1 voting per DEED held as on date. Deed DAO would be the primary governance body consisting of DEX users & developers with powers to vote on any changes in DEX contract as defined in contract upon creation. While its important to have equal opportunity for every user (hance 1 vote for 1 DEED), however the voting system design would encourage participation & provide control to most active users as they earn DEED based on activity on the DEX. Functions of Deed DEX (not exhaustive) that DAO members can vote on-


* Approving trusted third party oracle integrations with Deed DEX
* Adding, removing or updating trade fee tiers based on various asset types
* Determining DEX earnings distribution ratios between liquidity providers & traders
* Updating DEED token rewards computations ($100 trading volume= 1 DEED)
* Implementation of staking & yield farming contracts
* Listing DEED on other CEXs or DEXs


## Testnet

The purpose of testnet Deed app is to achieve basic product market fit on the thesis of tokenising & trading of internet assets as memecoins. For this, Deed app has used Tataum distributed ledger, Orderbook & tokenisation infra for Solana blockchain. While not a decentralised exchange technically, the Deed app is a progressive web app designed for mobile devices on apple ios & android OS providing an easy & intuitive experience to tokenise, launch pools and trade internet asset memecoins. Users can earn DEED on testnet by trading & exchange testnet DEED for mainnet 1:1 upon launch. This ensures progressive decentralisation from day zero. Testnet app is available here- [Download App](https://deed.so/download-app)
