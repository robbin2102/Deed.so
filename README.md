# Deed: Onchain Economies & Capital Markets for (Web2) Internet

[https://deed.so](https://deed.so)

Deed is building the **onchain asset economies & capital market** layer for Web2 assets — including YouTube channels, Instagram accounts, games, apps, Shopify stores or any website or app — by turning communities into contributors, not just consumers.

## 🔍 What is Deed?

Deed is a mobile based dapp that lets:

- **Asset Owners** launch liquidity pools for online assets and assign "deeds" (tasks) to grow asset metrics (subs, followers, signups, sales etc).
- **Communities** perform deeds to earn SOL/ETH instantly or asset tokens from liquidity pools.
- **Traders/LPs** access high-yield pools backed by verified assets and trade tokens of fast-growing internet properties.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

The internet is home to 200M+ communities — from creators to apps — but there's no native way for those communities to:

- Earn from asset growth
- Contribute to development or distribution
- Share in revenues or token upside

Deed unlocks this potential by turning each asset into a tokenized onchain economy.
