# Deed Utility Layer for Meme Token Markets
Deed is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to add utility to meme token markets, available on the testnet at https://deed.so/.

## Overview

Memecoins drive 73% of volumes on major decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The primary utility of meme tokens today is speculation. The characteristics of these markets are reminiscent of the first stock markets in Amsterdam:

* Short-life: 99% of meme tokens created are abandoned daily with liquidity withdrawals.
* Scams: Rug pulls are common.
* Low liquidity: Unstable and bait LP farms with unrealistic APRs to trap liquidity.
* Quick profits: Traders aim for quick gains.
* Casino wins: Only a small percentage of experienced traders make money while retail investors mostly lose.

## Problems in Current Meme Token Markets

### For Traders and Liquidity Providers (LPs)

* Short-life span with ~95% pools abandoned daily due to rug pulls.
* Duplicate tokens with the same metadata splitting market TVLs and volumes.
* Liquidity traps with high yield pools.
* No underlying asset data, metrics, or news to consistently trade meme tokens.
* Poor trading experience on mobile devices.

### For Meme Token Creators

* Short-term and unsteady earnings with meme tokens created and abandoned daily.
* High competition and lack of moat due to duplicate tokens with the same metadata.
* Difficulty in building genuine communities around memes due to duplicacy of token metadata.
* Misaligned incentive structure leading to poor user experience and lower volumes and earnings.
